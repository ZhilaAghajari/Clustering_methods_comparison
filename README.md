# Clustering Methods Comparison

In this project, I implemented two clustering algorithms, **K-means clustering** and **Spectral clustering** from scratch. I investigated these methods on two datasets available here: 

[Cho dataset](https://chogenome.org/data.php)

[Iyer dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHTaMp_9yfID6Qlwg1YsLnfmwu2g2C7A/view)


A 2 component of each dataset is shown here:



To evaluate the results of the clustering algorithms, I used **Entropy and Purity**. However, since the lables of the data samples are not always known and accessible to us, I also investigated an internal index, **Silhouettee index** which evaluate the quality of the clusters.
