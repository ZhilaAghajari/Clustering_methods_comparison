# Clustering Methods Comparison

In this project, I implemented two clustering algorithms, “K-means clustering” and “Spectral clustering” from scratch.

To evaluate the results of the clustering algorithms, I used Entropy and Purity. However, since the lables of the data samples are not always known and accessible to us, I also investigated an internal index, Silhouettee ubdex which evaluate the quality of the clusters.
